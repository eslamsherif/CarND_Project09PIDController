- The first time to run the pid all gains are set to one so all of the curves fall on top of each other
Implementation seems ok, though still the dt for differential gain is assumed to be 1
The car performance seems to be as if it is a P only controller

Car crashed after less than 4 secs.

Next step tuning the gains.
